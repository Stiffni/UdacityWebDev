# Memory Game Project
This repo contains all the source code for a browser-based memory card game, which I'm working on in order to achieve the Udacity Web Developer Nanodegree.

## Getting Started
Take a look at the source code in github, or feel free to clone this repo and open the `index.html` in your favourite browser to try the game yourself.
