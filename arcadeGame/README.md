# Arcade Game
This repo contains all the source code for a road crossing arcade style game, which I'm working on in order to achieve the Udacity Web Developer Nanodegree.

## Getting Started/Running the Game
Take a look at the source code in github, or feel free to clone this repo and open the `index.html` in your favourite browser to play the game!

### How To Play
Use the arrow keys (left, right, up, down) to move you character from the safe grassy area at the bottom of the game grid, to the water tiles at the other side. Be careful not to get hit by the nasty lady bugs, or you'll get sent back to the starting line!
