# Feed Reader
This repo contains all the source code for a feed reader built by Udacity. I've updated it to include tests for a project I'm working on in order to achieve the Udacity Web Developer Nanodegree.

## Getting Started/Running the Tests
Take a look at the source code in github, the tests can be found in `/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js`. Feel free to clone this repo and open the `index.html` in your favourite browser to run the tests and view the results.
