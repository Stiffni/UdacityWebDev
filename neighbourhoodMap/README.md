# Neighbourhood Map Project

This repo contains all the source code for the Neighbourhood Map app, which I'm working on in order to achieve the Udacity Web Developer Nanodegree.
This app shows you my favourite restaurants where I live, and shows Yelp reviews using their API. This project uses React for these components.
